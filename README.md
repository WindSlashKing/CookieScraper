# CookieScraper
A Python script that lets you log into an account through Google Chrome and gives you the login cookies for your website of choice. You can later then inject the cookies into another browser in order to be logged in there too.

# Use cases
This is useful for when you need to automate tasks in websites that require you to log in. Examples of such websites are Instagram, Youtube, Pinterest etc. These websites usually have strict protection against automated browsers like Selenium and rate limit or block logins but by using cookies you can bypass both of these restrictions.
